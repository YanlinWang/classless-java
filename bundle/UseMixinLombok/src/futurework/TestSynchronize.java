/*
 \yanlin{ what would happen if Classless Java is used in parallel programming
setting. Clearly interfaces (even with our annotation) cannot model everything
classes support, especially in a parallel setting, the use of Java keyword
`synchronized` is limited inside interfaces. One of the limitation is that
`synchronized` canâ€™t be applied on a method inside interface as in classes (This
is true for both default and static methods).

One workaround is: instead of synchronize on a whole method, we use
synchronized block on `this` (see interface B). But whether this workaround is
correct still needs experiment. I think this maybe another limitation of our
approach. }
